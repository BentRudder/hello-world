# hello-world
just another repository

Hi, I'm basically what I would call an aspiring Game Devloper with an interest in Game Design, and a broad interest in all aspects of Game Development. Currently I'm new to, and working on learning C++, looking at pathfinding and AI, and other game systems. While I have-to date-spent around 10 years studying Game Development as an observer, I also have a background in pen and paper role-playing game design, though far from professionally as it was a hobby for me.

Lately, though it is far from my professional field in a lot of ways, I have decided to get more involved in the GameDev process, starting with learning about programming in C++, (ironically perhaps, I find it easier than other languages, though I think that's primarily due to its structure), and looking at the Godot Game Engine and A* Pathfinding Algorithms. 

I tend to learn best by example, or to put it another way, if I delve into something like a game engine and functional code, I am more likely to develop an understanding of how it works than if I watch 60 hours of tutorials that essentially describe code, but seldom actually do anything. Aside from examples of, "Hello World!," and creating basic calculators, (which is still valuable; don't get me wrong).

i.e.

#include <iostream>
  
using namespace std;

int main();

{

  int a;
  
  int b;
  
  int sum;
  
  
  cout << "Hello World!" << endl;
  
  cout << "This is a math problem: " << endl;
  
  
  cout << "Enter a number!" << endl;
  
  cin >> a;
  
  cout << "Enter another number!" << endl;
  
  cin >> b;
  
  sum = a + b;
  
  cout << "The sum of those numbers is: "<< sum << endl;
  
  
  
  Return 0;
  
}

That's the first C++ code I've ever written; I'm willing to admit I had to bounce back and forth in a tutorial to do it.

Cheers,
